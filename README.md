COMBAT POVERY ORGANIZE COMMUNITY

The evolution of CPOC is to become a school that teaches people how to be a good at running a city with a carbon neutral budget.  This means that you have a city that pulls out as much carbon from the atmosphere as the city creates.  CPOC exists because current city officials know nothing about this challenge that our children will have to solve.
